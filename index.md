*Hello! My name is Jennifer Karnosky, and this page is underconstruction. I will be adding content to showcase new skills learned in the MS in Business Analytics (BA) program at the College of William and Mary. My hope is to embark on my analytics journey with a strong portfolio that includes:*

- âœ¨ Strong Execution of the BA process
- âœ¨ Python Proficiency
- âœ¨ Data Visualization and Presentation
- âœ¨ R Programming 
- âœ¨ XML, JSON, and HTML Web Scraping
- âœ¨ Algorithm Development


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and gain hands on experience. If you have openings to join a project involving any of the skills I listed, I'd love to dedicate my time to the process. I believe experiential learning is the best avenue to mastery.

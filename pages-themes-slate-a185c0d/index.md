*Hello! My name is Jennifer Karnosky, and this page is underconstruction. I will be adding content to showcase new skills learned in the MS in Business Analytics (BA) program at the College of William and Mary. 🌱 I’m currently learning the language of business analytics in **Competing Through Business Analytics** and hope to embark on my analytics journey with a strong portfolio that includes:*

- ✨ Strong Execution of the BA process
- ✨ Python Proficiency
- ✨ Data Visualization and Presentation
- ✨ R Programming 
- ✨ XML, JSON, and HTML Web Scraping
- ✨ Algorithm Development


- 👯 I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and gain hands on experience. If you have openings to join a project involving any of the skills I listed, I'd love to dedicate my time to the process. I believe experiential learning is the best avenue to mastery.
